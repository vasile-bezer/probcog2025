The course focuses on how probabilistic (Bayesian) modelling provides a general framework to understand and explain a variety of phenomena in cognition, perception and action - a framework known as **the Bayesian brain**. The key concept is to model the brain as performing statistical inference.

This course focuses on both the mathematical theory and practical numerical modelling and programming. Thus, besides Bayesian modeling of various aspects of cognition, the course will cover numerical and statistical techniques for model building and model fitting applied to probabilistic cognitive modeling.

Topics covered include:

- Introduction to probabilistic (Bayesian) observer modelling;
- Recap of probability and numerical methods;
- How to model noisy perception as inference;
- Predicting behavior from observer models;
- Fitting Bayesian observer (and other) models to data;
- Applications of Bayesian observer models to concrete examples and case studies, such as: cue combination, learning, motor control, "causal inference" in multisensory perception (the specific applications being covered may change depending on the year).

- The course will use publicly available textbooks, complemented as needed with slides and lecture notes, plus Python notebooks for the coding parts. All study materials will be made available in the course Moodle area. Ma, Kording & Goldreich, "Bayesian models of perception and action", MIT Press 2022.
